%     The BILIRUBIN attribute appears to be continuously-valued.  I checked
%     this with the donater, Bojan Cestnik, who replied:
% 
%       About the hepatitis database and BILIRUBIN problem I would like to say
%       the following: BILIRUBIN is continuous attribute (= the number of it's
%       "values" in the ASDOHEPA.DAT file is negative!!!); "values" are quoted
%       because when speaking about the continuous attribute there is no such
%       thing as all possible values. However, they represent so called
%       "boundary" values; according to these "boundary" values the attribute
%       can be discretized. At the same time, because of the continious
%       attribute, one can perform some other test since the continuous
%       information is preserved. I hope that these lines have at least roughly
%       answered your question.
