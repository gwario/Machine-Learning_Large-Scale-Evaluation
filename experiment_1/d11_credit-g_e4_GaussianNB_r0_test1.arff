% 
% Two datasets are provided.  the original dataset, in the form provided
% by Prof. Hofmann, contains categorical/symbolic attributes and
% is in the file "german.data".
% 
% For algorithms that need numerical attributes, Strathclyde University
% produced the file "german.data-numeric".  This file has been edited
% and several indicator variables added to make it suitable for
% algorithms which cannot cope with categorical variables.   Several
% attributes that are ordered categorical (such as attribute 17) have
% been coded as integer.    This was the form used by StatLog.
% 
% 
% 6. Number of Attributes german: 20 (7 numerical, 13 categorical)
