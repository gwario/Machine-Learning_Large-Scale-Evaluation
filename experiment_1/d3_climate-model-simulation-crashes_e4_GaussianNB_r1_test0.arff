% %  This data was constructed using LLNL's UQ Pipeline, was created under the auspices

% %  Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344, was funded by LLNL's Uncertainty Quantification Strategic

% %  Data Set Information:
% %
% %  This dataset contains records of simulation crashes encountered during climate model
% %  uncertainty quantification (UQ) ensembles.
% %
% %  Ensemble members were constructed using a Latin hypercube method in LLNL's UQ Pipeline
% %  software system to sample the uncertainties of 18 model parameters within the Parallel
% %  Ocean Program (POP2) component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4).
% %
% %  Three separate Latin hypercube ensembles were conducted, each containing 180 ensemble
% %  members. 46 out of the 540 simulations failed for numerical reasons at combinations
% %  of parameter values.
% %
% %  The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) from
% %  input parameter values, and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to
% %  determine the causes of simulation crashes.
% %
% %  Further details about the data and methods are given in the publication 'Failure Analysis
% %  of Parameter-Induced Simulation Crashes in Climate Models,' Geoscientific Model
% %  Development ([Web Link]).
% %
% %  Attribute Information:
% %
% %  The goal is to predict climate model simulation outcomes (column 21, fail or succeed)
% %  given scaled values of climate model input parameters (columns 3-20).
% %
% %  Column 1: Latin hypercube study ID (study 1 to study 3)
% %
% %  Column 2: simulation ID (run 1 to run 180)
% %
% %  Columns 3-20: values of 18 climate model parameters scaled in the interval [0, 1]
% %
% %  Column 21: simulation outcome (0 = failure, 1 = success)
