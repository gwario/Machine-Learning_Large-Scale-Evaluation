%     1. Smith,~J.~W., Everhart,~J.~E., Dickson,~W.~C., Knowler,~W.~C., \&
%        Johannes,~R.~S. (1988). Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast
%        the onset of diabetes mellitus.  In {\it Proceedings of the Symposium
%        on Computer Applications and Medical Care} (pp. 261--265).  IEEE
%        Computer Society Press.
% 
%        The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the
%        patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization
%        criteria (i.e., if the 2 hour post-load plasma glucose was at least
%        200 mg/dl at any survey  examination or if found during routine medical
%        care).   The population lives near Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
% 
%        Results: Their ADAP algorithm makes a real-valued prediction between
%        0 and 1.  This was transformed into a binary decision using a cutoff of
%        0.448.  Using 576 training instances, the sensitivity and specificity
%        of their algorithm was 76% on the remaining 192 instances.
% 
% 4. Relevant Information:
%       Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from
%       a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at
%       least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning
%       routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like
%       devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.
